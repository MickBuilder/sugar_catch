Based on my comprehensive analysis of the Sweetr codebase, here are the key
  issues and areas for improvement:

  Critical Issues

  1. Security Vulnerabilities

  - API Key Exposure: Mixpanel token (6e107d019328a406e54329a552978451) and
  RevenueCat key (appl_jCSpxavIhZwlsIuFMpqilajUdfq) are hardcoded in source
  code /Users/mikeb/build/mobile-apps/sugar_catch/app/lib/core/services/revenu
  ecat_service.dart:5
  - .env file not properly ignored: Contains sensitive tokens
  /Users/mikeb/build/mobile-apps/sugar_catch/app/.env:2

  2. Dependency Management Issues

  - Wrong import: flutter_riverpod instead of hooks_riverpod in
  /Users/mikeb/build/mobile-apps/sugar_catch/app/lib/features/onboarding/onboa
  rding_provider.dart:1
  - Severely outdated packages: 31 packages have newer versions, including
  major security updates
  - Discontinued packages: build_resolvers and build_runner_core are
  discontinued

  3. Code Quality Issues

  - Unused field: _progressBox in /Users/mikeb/build/mobile-apps/sugar_catch/a
  pp/lib/features/progress/data/progress_service.dart:8
  - 10 TODO comments: Unfinished features including error dialogs,
  notifications, and core functionality

  Performance & Architecture Issues

  4. Inefficient Data Operations

  - Synchronous heavy operations: Progress calculations in ProgressService run
   on main thread
  - No caching strategy: API calls lack proper caching mechanisms
  - Memory leaks potential: Missing disposal in providers and services

  5. Poor Error Handling

  - Silent failures: Multiple try-catch blocks that only log errors
  - Missing user feedback: TODOs indicate missing error dialogs in scan
  screens
  - No offline handling: App doesn't gracefully handle network failures

  6. Routing & Navigation Issues

  - Complex routing logic: Premium/onboarding routing creates potential
  infinite loops
  - No deep linking: Missing proper URL handling for product screens

  Maintainability Issues

  7. Code Organization

  - Mixed responsibilities: Services handling both business logic and UI state
  - Inconsistent patterns: Different error handling approaches across modules
  - Hard-coded values: Magic numbers and strings scattered throughout

  8. Testing & Documentation

  - No tests: Empty test directory indicates no test coverage
  - Missing documentation: No inline documentation for complex business logic
  - No API documentation: Service interfaces lack proper documentation

  Immediate Action Items

  1. URGENT: Move API keys to secure environment variables
  2. Fix dependency issues: Update flutter_riverpod import and upgrade
  packages
  3. Remove unused code: Clean up _progressBox field
  4. Implement missing error dialogs: Complete TODO items in scan screens
  5. Add proper caching: Implement offline-first data strategy
  6. Write tests: Add unit and integration tests
  7. Update dependencies: Upgrade to latest stable versions

  The app shows good architectural patterns with Riverpod and clean separation
   of concerns, but critical security and performance issues need immediate
  attention.
